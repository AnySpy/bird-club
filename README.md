# The Bird Club at Missouri State University's Website

This is the repo that holds the resources for the Missouri State University website! The website is written in [Astro](https://astro.build/) with static HTML for budget constraints.

# About The Missouri State University Bird Club

At The Bird Club, we want to provide students an opportunity to get out, enjoy nature, and learn about birds. We do this by offering field trips, volunteer activities, and more! We are a campus chapter of the National Audubon Society. We welcome all levels of experience, from those who are simply curious to experienced birders.

We are also a chapter of the Greater Ozarks Audubon Society! They have helped us extensively with maintaining this club and we are eternally grateful for them!

# Contributing

I will only allow contributing access to verified officers of the club who request it! If you have an idea or a better way to do something I have implemented, message me on Github and I'll provide credit as necessary!

# Roadmap

I need to make a better "About Us" page. I'm having block with that. On top of that, the footer is very basic and I'd like to make it better.
